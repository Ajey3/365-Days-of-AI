# Day 3: Daily Inspirational Quotes App

## Project Overview
The Daily Inspirational Quotes App is a simple, AI-powered application that fetches a new, motivational quote each day from the Zen Quotes API and displays it in a minimalistic, user-friendly interface. This project is part of a 365-day challenge to build AI-powered applications, starting from basic projects and progressing to more complex ones.

## Key Features
- **Daily Quotes**: The app fetches a new, random inspirational quote each time the user clicks the "Get New Quote" button.
- **Minimalistic UI**: Designed with simplicity in mind, the interface keeps the focus on the quote itself.
- **External API Integration**: Uses the Zen Quotes API to retrieve quotes, providing an introduction to using external APIs in Python.
